End-to-End ML Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction
Objective
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the Telco Churn dataset with scikit-learn.

Workflow
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale numeric features, encode categoricals.

Pipeline: Scikit-learn Pipeline with ColumnTransformer.

Models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest (with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning).

Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, classification report.

Model Export: Save pipeline with joblib for deployment.

How to Run
Clone the repo and install requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the provided Jupyter notebook or script.

Results
Logistic Regression: Accuracy: (your value), F1-score: (your value)

Random Forest: Accuracy: (your value), F1-score: (your value)
